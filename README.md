# Reddit Transcription Bot

The Reddit Transcription Bot (final name pending) transcribes text from images posted on Reddit on request. The images may be part of a post on a subreddit, or linked to within a comment. The bot will reply with a comment containing an attempted transcription of the text contained with the image.

This Reddit Bot is a part of a project created by 3 students in CS 298-01 at Western Connecticut State University. It is currently still within the initial planning process.

### Original Project Idea

**High Level Description:** Social Media Bot

**Minimum Requirements:**

- Ingest content from a social media platform using an API
- Analyze content (identify relevant text). Involves parsing what is likely to be a JSON object
- Generate a post based on the analyzed content. The post should have some markup other than text (hashtags, URLs, Markdown, etc)
- Post to the social media site - Ideally. It is possible that external issues may prevent this from happening, in which case a simulated post is sufficient.


**Likely Social Media Platform:** Reddit

Reddit has a relatively generous public API and is friendly towards non-malicious bots. It also has a variety of content and many already existing bots that can be used for inspiration and guidance (what to do and not to do, e.g. some subreddits do not allow bots).
