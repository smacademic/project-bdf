### **Project Idea**
 **High Level Description:** Social Media Bot

**Minimum Requirements:**
<ol>
  <li>Ingest content from a social media platform using an API</li>
  <li>Analyze content (identify relevant text). Involves parsing what is likely to be a JSON object</li>
  <li>Generate a post based on the analyzed content. The post should have some markup other than text (hashtags, URLs, Markdown, etc)</li>
  <li>Post to the social media site - Ideally. It is possible that external issues may prevent this from happening, in which case a             simulated post is sufficient.</li>
</ol>

**Likely Social Media Platform:** Reddit

<p>Reddit has a relatively generous public API and is friendly towards non-malicious bots. It also has a variety of content and many already existing bots that can be used for inspiration and guidance (what to do and not to do, e.g. some subreddits do not allow bots).</p>
